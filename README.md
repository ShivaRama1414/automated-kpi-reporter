# automated-kpi-reporter
An automation workflow built with n8n that pulls data from Google Sheets (or a database), calculates daily or weekly KPIs (e.g., sales, conversions, uptime), formats the metrics, and automatically sends reports to stakeholders via Gmail or Slack. Ideal for teams that want hands-free reporting and real-time performance tracking.
